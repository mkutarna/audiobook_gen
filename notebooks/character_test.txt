The Greek alphabet was developed to write the Greek language about 1000 BC. It is the ancestor of modern languages and is derived from the Phoenician alphabet. There are 24 letters in the Greek alphabet. The vowels: are α, ε, η, ι, ο, ω, υ. All the rest are consonants. Alpha is the first letter of the alphabet, and the last letter is omega.
